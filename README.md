# QR Portal Card

An alternate take on the QR component challenge with a neon, glassy card and layered gradients. The page stays simple—just HTML and CSS—and keeps the starter design assets out of version control.

## Stack
- HTML & CSS only (no build tools)
- Google Fonts: Space Grotesk + Inter

## Running
Open `index.html` in your browser. Everything is bundled inline.

## Notes
- The look intentionally diverges from the reference design: dark palette, glowing borders, and pill accents.
- `.gitignore` excludes the provided design previews to avoid publishing them.
- Feel free to swap the QR image source or CTA link to point at your own destination.
