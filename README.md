# QR Portal Card

An alternate take on the QR component challenge with a neon, glassy card and layered gradients. The QR and CTA both link to my GitHub profile.

## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- Modern CSS (flexbox, gradients, glassmorphism)
- Google Fonts (Space Grotesk, Inter)
- Mobile-first layout

### What I learned
- Layering multiple gradients and pseudo-elements can create depth without images.
- Even single-page challenges benefit from precise accessibility labels on linked images.
- Keeping design assets out of version control is easy with a focused `.gitignore`.

### Continued development
- Add a recorded GIF or screenshot for quick previews.
- Experiment with subtle motion (hover ripples, card parallax) while keeping performance in check.

## Useful resources
- [MDN: CSS gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient) — quick reference for stacking multiple gradient layers.
- [WebAIM: Alternative text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) — helps keep linked images accessible.
